      video-script:
        - do: Navigate to the `class repository`
          say: I have created a repository for this class. Please log in to GitHub using your user name and access <the class repository> now.
        - do: "Navigate to the issue `Class Goals`"
          say: I have created an issue titled Class Goals. Let's look at some of the special features in issues that we use to encourage collaboration.
        - do: Add an issue comment demonstrating markdown formatting for headers, checkboxes and emoji.
          say: GitHub uses a syntax called Markdown to help you add basic text formatting to issues.
        - do: "@mention any co-teachers"
          say: One of our favorite features is the @mention. When you @mention someone in an issue, they will receive a notification - even if they are not currently subscribed to the issue or watching the repository.
        - do: Click `Preview`
          say: You can use the preview tab to see how your comment will be rendered (meaning how GitHub will actually display your Markdown file) before you click the comment button.
        - do: Include an issue attachment
          say: You can also add pictures by simply dragging and dropping them into the comment field, or clicking the file uploader link.
        - do: Click `Comment`
          say: Click the green comment button to add your comments to the discussion.
        - do: Learners comment on issue
          say: I would like to add you all as collaborators to this repository, but first I will need your GitHub user names. Please add a comment to this issue so I can add you to the collaborator's team
        - do: Return to the `Issues` view
          say: As you can imagine, a large project can have a hundreds of issues. Let's look at a few ways your project team can organize issues.
        - do: "`Assign` the issue to the co-teacher"
          say: First, you can assign issues to anyone with access to the repo. Typically, this will be the person who is currently responsible for working on the project. The issue assignee may change over time.
        - do: Add a `label` to the issue
          say: You can also use labels to help you organize issues. GitHub comes with a number of built-in labels, but you can always delete those or add more of your own. As a project grows in size, using assignees and labels makes it much easier to find a given issue or pull request.
        - do: "Click `Issues > Filters`"
          say: Most projects have a large number of issues and pull requests. Filters allow you to easily search for Issues or Pull Requests by creator, labels, assignees and more. We will continue to explore these features throughout the course. For now, let's practice creating issues!

        - Let's practice creating issues now!
      steps:
        - description: "Create an Issue to add your bio to the repo. The issue should contain each of the following: your name, a request to add your bio, some markdown formatting, and an @mention for the instructor."
          verifications:
            - verification-type: issue-created
              success-message: "Great job - you created an issue."
              failure-message: "It looks like you didn't create an issue. Want to try again?"
        - description: Assign the issue you just created to yourself # optional for Monday
          verifications:
            - verification-type: issue-assigned-to-self
              success-message: "Great job - you assigned the issue to yourself."
              failure-message: "It looks like you didn't assign the issue to yourself."
        - description: Apply the label of "Bio" to the issue # optional for Monday
          verifications:
            - verification-type: issue-labeled
              success-message: "Great job - you applied the 'Bio' label to the issue"
              failure-message: "It looks like you didn't apply the 'Bio' label to the issue."
