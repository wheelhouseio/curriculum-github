        In this section we'll go over how to use Pull Requests. Pull Requests, or "PRs", are one of the most important parts of the GitHub Flow.

        A PR is a request to merge one branch into another. They're used to discuss the changes made in the branch, and to continue to make changes until the branch is complete and the team agrees it can be merged. You'll use PRs frequently when working with your team, as they're the primary way to bring code on the master branch up to date with your feature branch once it's ready for production.

      video-script:
        - do: Show `Your recently pushed branches:` banner
          say: "GitHub knows that you have added changes to your branch and helpfully recommends that you start a pull request."
        - do: "Click `Compare & Pull Request`"
          say: "Go ahead and click the big green button to start your pull request."
        - do: "Show `base:` and `compare:` drop downs"
          say: "Notice that we can use the drop down here to compare any two branches. We will leave the defaults selected."
        - do: "Show default pull request message"
          say: "GitHub pre-populates the commit message as the pull request title. You can change this to help your collaborators better understand the intent of the change."
        - do: "Leave a comment"
          say: "Here you can leave a comment to describe the changes you made and why. As a best practice, you should reference the original issue or issues using the # notation."
        - do: "Click `Create pull request`"
          say: "When you are finished, choose the option to create a pull request."
        - do: "Show the `Conversation` view"
          say: "Similar to the discussion thread on an Issue, a Pull Request creates a discussion about the changes being made to the repository. This discussion is found in the Conversation tab."
        - do: "Show the `Commits` view"
          say: "The commits view contains information about who has made changes to the files. Each commit is an updated view of the repository, allowing us to see how changes have happened from commit to commit."
        - do: "Show the `Files changed` view"
          say: "The Files changed view allows you to see the change that is being proposed. We call this the `diff`. Notice that some of the text is highlighted in red. This is what has been removed. The green text is what has been added."
        - do: "Enter a `line comment` in the Files changed view"
          say: "If you notice something that needs to be changed, you can click on the line number in this view to create a line comment. Line level comments are a great way to give additional context on recommended changes."
        - do: "Return to the `Conversation` view"
          say: "Notice that the line comment was added to the main conversation."
        - do: "Add a comment to the discussion"
          say: "If your comment is more general in nature, you can also add a comment to the Pull Request using the same method we learned for Issues."
        - do: "Add a `:+1:` emoji"
          say: "Most project teams require someone to sign off on the change before it is merged. We like to use emoji to show our approval. In the previous lab you created a file, next you will create a pull request for your file."

        * Pull Requests (or PRs) are used to add code to another branch, in this case `master`.
        * A Pull Request asks that the team merge one branch into another.
        * The "base" is the branch you want to merge into (often `master`), the "compare" is the branch you're merging, in this case the feature branch.
        * Make sure to leave a comment to tell people what changes you made and why.
        * In the comment, you should put number sign (`#`) in front of the number of the issue that you're fixing. This will automatically link your PR to that issue.
        * Once you've made the PR, the `Files changed` view allows you to see what this PR will change on the base branch. Red means "deleted", green means "added". This view is often called the "diff".
        * You can add comments directly to the diff, or in the `Conversations` view.
