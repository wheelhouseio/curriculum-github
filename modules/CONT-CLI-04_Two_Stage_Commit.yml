        - After you have finished making your changes, it is time to commit them. When working from the command line, you will need to be familiar with the idea of the two stage commit.

      presenter-script:
        - When you work locally, your files exist in one of four states. They are either untracked, modified, staged, or committed.
        - An untracked file is one that is not currently part of the version controlled directory.

      image: two-stage-commit-c.jpg # Show diagram similar to Pro-Git's Lifecycle of the status of your files. The untracked, modified and staged sections are outside a circle while committed is inside the circle. The circle is labeled version control. Build the rest of the diagram as it is discussed. http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository Build the diagram as described below in coordination with the context description shown above. Show 4 files as untracked. Show 2 of the files moving to staged. Show the 2 files moving from staged to committed.
      presenter-script:
        - To add these files to version control, you will create a collection of files that represent a discrete unit of work. We build this unit in the staging area.

      presenter-script:
        - When we are satisfied with the unit of work we have assembled, we will commit everything in the staging area.

      presenter-script:
        - In order to make a file part of the version controlled directory we will first do a git add and then we will do a git commit. Let's do it now.

        - do: Type git status
          say: Remember that Git status allows us to see the status of the files on our branch at any given time.
        - do: View status output
          say: You will see that your file is listed under heading Changes not staged for commit and the file says it has been modified.
        - do: Type git add <file-name.md>
          say: Let's go ahead and type git add and the name of the file.
        - do: Type 'git status'
          say: And then type git status again to see what has changed.
        - do: View status output
          say: Now your file is listed under the heading Changes to be commited. This tells us that the file is in the staging area.
        - do: Type git commit
          say: Next you will type git commit. This tells git to collect all of the files in the staging area and commit them to version control as a single unit of work. Git will open your default text editor where you can enter the commit message.
        - do: Type the commit message
          say: "Simply type the commit message in the text editor. Any line without a # will be included in the commit message."
        - do: Save the message and Close the text editor
          say: When you are happy with your commit message, simply save it and close your text editor.
        - do: Show git output message for commit
          say: Git provides confirmation when the commit is complete.
