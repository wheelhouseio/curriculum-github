        - "Now that you have cloned the repository and checked out your branch, you are ready to make some changes to the local files. If you are familiar with using the command line to open and edit files, then much of this will be familiar to you. The only difference here is that we will be making our changes on a branch. Let's add more information to the bio we created earlier."

          say: "Before you make any changes, you will want to double check that you are on the correct branch."
        - do: Type `cd bios`
          say: "Technically you could just open the file with the Finder window or Windows Explorer, but let's stay purely on the command line for now and cd into the bios folder. "
        - do: Type `atom <file-name.md>`
          say: "I am going to modify my file in atom, so I will use the command line to open atom and the file all at once. You can use your favorite text editor to make changes to your file. "
        - do: Type changes in the file
          say: Add more information about yourself to the end of the original file.
        - do: Click `Save > Quit`
          say: "When you are finished, save the file and close the text editor. "
