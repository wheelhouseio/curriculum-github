        - do: "Type `git pull origin`"
          say: "Now that everyone has merged and pushed their changes to the remote, let's pull those changes back to our local copy. We can do this with git pull."
        - do: "Type `git log`"
          say: "We have made a few commits, let's take a look at our project history. Git log is the most basic command. It provides a list of all of the commits made on our branch with the most recent commit first."
        - do: "Press `q`"
          say: "You can press the up or down arrows or press enter to view additional log entries. Type q to quit viewing the log and return to the command prompt."
        - do: "Type `git log --oneline`"
          say: "Git log has a great deal of information, but it is a little verbose. If you would like to see a condensed version, add the --oneline option."
        - do: "Type `git log --oneline --graph`"
          say: "The log command has many options and you can actually string them together to create a view that is most helpful for your situation. For example, you can add an ASCII graph of the branch and merge history of our project by adding the option --graph."
        - do: "Type `git log --oneline --graph --decorate`"
          say: "If you would like more information about the branches and where HEAD is located, you can add the --decorate option."
        - do: "Type `git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all`"
          say: "If you also want to include un-merged branches, you should add the option --all."
        - do: "Type `git log --stat`"
          say: "If you would like to see which files were involved in each commit, use the --stat option."
        - do: "Type `git log --patch`"
          say: "And if you would like to see the actual changes that were made, use --patch."

        * `git pull` updates the local directory to include all the changes made to the remote directory, even those done by other people.
        * `git log` provides a list of all of the commits on the current branch, with the most recent commit first.
        * `Up` and `down` arrows navigate, `enter` cycles through log entries, and `q` quits log viewing screen.
        * `git log --oneline` shows a smaller version of the log.
        * `git log --oneline --graph` shows a graph of the changes along with the one-line log.
        * `git log --oneline --graph --decorate` includes information about the branches and the head.
        * `git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all` also includes unmerged branches.
        * `git log --stat` tells you which files were included in each commit.
        * `git log --patch` shows the actual changes that were made in each commit as diffs.
